##Caveat 
It seems like that one of our project member code is not written on his own and
it is a complete "copy-paste" from unknown source.

So the code in package - "com.beiluoshimen.securityguard.lockui" is totally disastrous.
It is recommend to "re-write the whole code" in com.beiluoshimen.securityguard.lockui package.

Caveat : NEVER COLLABORATE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS TOTALLY NOOB IN YOUR PROJECT.
HE WILL REALLY MEES UP YOUR WHOLE PROJECT.  :(  

If any code in this package - com.beiluoshimen.securityguard.lockui infringe your legal rights.
Please contact the project manager : beiluo.shimen@icloud.com and I will delete it immediately.
